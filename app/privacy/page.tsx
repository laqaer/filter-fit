          FilterFit ({site.domain}) is a content and affiliate comparison site published by{" "}
          {site.publisher}. This policy describes the small amount of information a directory like
          this typically handles. We do not run user accounts.
        </p>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Server and hosting logs.</strong> Our host (intended: Vercel) and any future
            CDN may record IP address, user agent, referrer, and requested URL to operate the site
            and stop abuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email you send us.</strong> Messages to {site.email} include whatever you
            write. We use that to reply. We do not add you to a newsletter by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optional analytics.</strong> If we later add a privacy-respecting analytics
            tool, this page will name it. None is required to read the guides today.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Affiliate and advertising technology</h2>
        <p>
          Some product mentions may become affiliate links. Clicking through to a retailer can
          cause that retailer or their network to set cookies, record that you came from FilterFit,
          and attribute a commission if you buy. Those companies have their own privacy policies.
          FilterFit does not receive your payment card number.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>ads.txt</code> on this site is a placeholder until authorized sellers are listed.
          If display ads are added, ad networks may use cookies or similar identifiers for
          frequency capping and fraud prevention. We will not pretend those vendors are invisible.
        </p>

        <h2>What we do not do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not sell a list of FilterFit readers as a product.</li>
          <li>We do not ask for account passwords or furnace serial numbers as a condition of reading.</li>
          <li>We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Retention and requests</h2>
        <p>
          Emails are kept as long as needed to handle the thread and basic bookkeeping. Hosting
          logs follow the host’s retention. To ask what we have from an email you sent, write{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${site.email}`}>{site.email}</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          If the site adds accounts, a newsletter, or live ad/affiliate tags, we will update this
          page and the date above.
        </p>
